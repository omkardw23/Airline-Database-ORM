# Airline-Database-ORM
Airport Management System Objective - An efficient database, which we create, will significantly reduce the complexity of airline management

Proposed work - The primary
objectives of the airport management plan are to develop an attainable phased development plan
concept that will satisfy the needs of the passenger in a safe, efficient, and economically sound
manner. The initial steps include writing down basic information and using NORMA to construct
the conceptual model. Creating a conceptualized model with all the entities and relationships
between them. Transitioning from the ORM model to the relational model after the ORM model,
and finish setting up our database in our local server management system. Then we have used the
Couchbase Enterprise edition to implement our database in NoSQL. To raise the caliber of the
database, locate a complete source of real-world data. Current work is based on a sample
database that just has a few entries in each table. Simple queries, stored procedures, and the use
of triggers for the insertion of new data to address some of the problems proposed and
implemented. For instance, utilizing the original database, problems like flight statistics (sorting
flights by distance) and airline management (fetching flights with specific clauses and using
multiple tables joins) were addressed.

Some Questions that were proposed in the initial proposal
• (Air traffic management) Questions related to the number of flights taking off from a particular
airport or landing on a particular airport. These kinds of questions will help us analyze flight
traffic and help develop a system to manage crowding over airports.
• (Graph planning/ Path optimization) Questions related to the availability of flights from one
source to destination. Such queries will help create a path/itinerary for a prospective traveler.
• (Cost optimization) Questions related to usage of fuel and reduction of cost for a traveler.
• (Flight Statistics) Maximum number of flights leaving an airport/ most visited airport/ etc. •
(Internal Aircraft System DB) Can be added for detailed design of internal aircraft systems. We
can pose questions like which sensor tables are used in certain processes and how they affect the
outcome of the flight software.
